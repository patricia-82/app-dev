## Favorite series? easily Harry Potter
Setting aside the **very problematic author** of the series, the Harry Potter books will always be an unshakeable favorite in my mind.
The hit series follows the life of a young wizard named Harry Potter. 
The story begins with Harry discovering his magical abilities and attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
Alongside his friends Ron and Hermione, Harry faces various challenges, uncovers dark secrets, and ultimately confronts the dark wizard ~~Lord Voldemort~~.

### Why is it my favorite?
Well, aside from the *very remarkable* and ultimately funny first sentence of the book
> "Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much."
I was mostly curious and very much in love with fiction - specifically ones regarding magic - during the time I first heard about the series.
Reading about the Wizarding World, especially from the point of view of someone who just discovered that world, was charming and pulled me in.
Of course, the plotline and the characters were of striking points, but the main seller for me was this *seemingly* fictional world where magic existed and was hidden from ~~most of the world~~ muggles.
